                            Throughout human history there hasn’t been a civilization as powerful as the modern western civilization. As referred to by the great British historian, Arnold Toynbee, a “civilization on trial”. Through its industrial and technological revolution, it has taken over and stamped its authority over mankind like no other civilization ever has done in history. Not only has it given to the world advanced technology it has unfortunately so made religious way of life moribund to the museums of history. The current state of the world is one in which the power now lies on the foundations of those godless oppressors who have a lust to rule the world either by hook or by crook.

                            Events to have unfolded in the last century or so and in particular since the past two decades have resulted in momentous changes in the state of the world. Be it the 9/11 terror attack on New York (which had all the footprints of a false flag attack) which then laid ground for the barbaric US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, the 2011 regime change war in Syria resulting in massacres and killing of hundreds and thousands of innocent civilians in particular Christian’s and the oppression that has only intensified in the Holy Land (Palestine) the latest being in Gaza where Israel has been committing genocide of the Palestinian people.

                            Those ruling over us have spent billions in order to brainwash mankind through their mainstream media which has only propagated lies, falsehood and deceived the masses in order to keep us in the darkness and done everything in order to differ the reality from appearance.

                            It is with the faith in Lord God, all Mighty and through the internal intuitive spiritual insight that He bestows upon his faithful servants connected with the knowledge of geopolitics, history, religion, international relations, etc we share an in-depth analysis of the current state of world affairs.

                            The two communities to have suffered most since last few centuries have been the Christians and the Muslims and it literally began from the Crusades where the western Chrsistianity waged bogus wars (the Orthodox Christianity never took part in the Crusades) which led to spilling of enormous bloodshed of Muslims and Christians themselves, this also was a black dot on the heart of the Christian world and the same happened with the world of Islam which through the Ottoman empire waged unjust wars on the Christian community and also sinfully converted the largest Chritisan cathedral Hagia Sophia into a Mosque.

                        <p>
                            At the heart of Islamic and Chrisitian eschatology is the return of the true Messiah, Jesus, the son of Virgin Mary, so it is imperative that the two people who share a lot more in common come and unite together. Those who rule over the modern western civilization have sabotaged every effort to unite the two people.

                            Through our blog we seek to unite different communities with the primary focus being on the Muslim - Christian alliance as we move along this historical process where truth shall prevail over all rivals.
