The above lines have been recorded by the former president of Guatemala, Juan José Arévalo, in his beautifully written book Sharks and Sardines. This fascinating book provides an in-depth understanding of the oppressive nature of godless modern Western civilization and its effects on South America. How has Pax Americana waged so many wars and spilled so much blood, yet gotten away with it?


Pax Americana like Pax Britannica considers itself above the law; where everyone must bend their knees in submission. It is these Sharks that have been waging a vicious war on the people of Gaza. According to them there is no law, they consider themselves above the law. They try to play God, Their arrogance is such that the Israeli defense minister called the Palestinians as human animals, which literally sent a message to the whole world that the war on Gaza would be a war of extermination. It would be a war were they would make a “joke” of the so called international law. This is precisely how Israel views its war on the Muslims and Christians of the Holy Land.


The most ominous factor in the current ongoing war has been Israel’s continuous rejection of world opinion. None of the international institutions, such as the United Nations, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), or even the President of the United States, have been able to stop Israel’s brutality. What explains such a war, the complete silence of the world of Islam, and the momentous changes taking place at this moment in history?


If indeed the Quran is the word of the Lord God, it must explain such extraordinary events. It must explain the greatest oppressor on the world stage, and it surely must explain the current world order.


The Quran itself states:

“And We revealed the Book (the Qur'an) to you as an explanation of everything…”(16:89)


**1) Ignorance and betrayal of the Arab world**


It has been over nine months, and the brutal war on Gaza has led to thousands of deaths. The people of Gaza aren't the only Arabs to have suffered at the hands of the Godless modern Western civilization; Syria, Yemen, and Iraq have also suffered tremendously. While one part of Arabia is under great oppression and poverty, another part is living off the sweat of the masses.


The Gulf nations (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, etc.) were once desert lands where barefoot shepherds used to roam the deserts of Arabia in search of livelihood. A sudden transformation then took place, and these barefoot shepherds began competing in building tall buildings (Burj Khalifa, Clock towers of Makkah, etc.). Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) prophesied such an event 1400 years ago.


The Prophet (ﷺ) was asked about the signs of the last days and here is one of the signs he mentioned: “When you see barefoot, naked, destitute shepherds competing in constructing tall buildings.” (Sunan Ibn Majah)


What led to this transformation, and how did these parts of Arabia become filthy rich, leading to their imitation of New York, London, Paris, etc., in every aspect of life? Before explaining the transformation of the Arab world, let us see what the Quran has to say about an alliance with oppressors.


The following verse from the Quran offers an ominous warning to Arab leaders: "O believers! Do not take such Jews and Christians as friends/allies who themselves are friends/allies of each other. Whoever does so will be counted as one of them. Surely, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people." (5:51)


Jews and Christians were never friends in history until the Zionist movement was formed; hence, the ayah refers to Zionist Jews and Christians, not all Jews and all Christians.


Alliance with Zionist Jews / Christians


It is important, in the context of our subject, to shed some light on the alliance between the British and Ibn Saud, known as the founder of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. After Hashemite King Sharif Husain had claimed the Caliphate for himself, Britain gave the green light to Ibn Saud to use his forces against Sharif Hussein. Ibn Saud then claimed control over Makkah with the help of the British; in the process, he also received a monthly sum of 5,000 pounds sterling from the British treasury in return for his benevolent neutrality in Husain's rebellion against the Caliph. Thus, the foundation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was laid out with the help of the British!


Another ominous event that took place in 1973, right after the Yom Kippur War, was when Henry Kissinger deceived King Faisal with one of the greatest diplomatic moves ever recorded in modern political history. An agreement was made between the United States and Saudi Arabia to sell oil in US dollars, which gave birth to the petrodollar monetary system. This deal primarily led to the Arabs getting filthy rich, hence paving the way for their embrace of the Godless modern Western civilization.


From 1973 to now, around 50 years have passed. All these years have witnessed a massive transformation of the Gulf States. All the kings and crown princes are billionaires and are comfortably living off the sweat of the masses. In the meantime, through the oil deals and the establishment of military bases (the largest being in Qatar), a very strong alliance has developed between the Arabs, the United States, and Israel. It is safe to say that most of the Gulf States are now client states serving the Judeo-Christian alliance. When the Arabs themselves are serving the Godless, decadent civilization, there is no way we can expect them to protect and help our brothers and sisters in Gaza, nor expect them to lead an Islamic response to the oppression in the Holy Land.


While the Arab world has allied with the oppressors, what explains the universal silence from other parts of the world of Islam, and most notably from the scholars of Islam? Such is the state of affairs that the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, can openly address the world from the United States Congress and declare that "practically zero" people have been killed in Rafah! Even after stating monstrous lies, he faces no challenge from the world of Islam, or for that matter, from the rest of the world. How do these sharks keep getting away with committing crimes against humanity, while a man named Imran Khan, whose only crime was to challenge the modern West, now faces imprisonment? How do we explain this indispensable power of the sharks?


**2) Gog and Magog**


“Allah will reveal to Jesus (peace be upon him) these words: I have brought forth among My servants such people against whom none will be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah will send Gog and Magog and they will swarm down from every slope….” (Sahih Muslim)


The word "Gog and Magog" has been referred to directly in the Quran twice and has been mentioned in several Hadiths of the blessed Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). Today, in the world of Islam, there is a lone, solitary voice who has had the ability to penetrate this subject with matchless integrity, courage, honesty, and with internal, intuitive spiritual insight of the highest order i.e., Sheikh Imran Hosein. It is his study of Islamic Eschatology that has enabled him to penetrate such a complex subject; his work, "Jerusalem in the Quran", has become the elucidation of the 21st century.


It is only through the lens of Islamic eschatology that we can explain the current world order and the current state of the Holy Land. This is one of the primary reasons why the world of Islam has been unable to adequately respond to the events unfolding in the world today. Nor can anyone explain the seemingly invincible power of the modern West.


Gog and Magog in the Quran


There are two instances where the Lord God makes mention of Gog and Magog:


“They said, ‘O Dhul-Qarnain! Gog and Magog commit Fasad (corruption, awesome oppression, and wickedness) in the land…’” (18:94)


The very first instance in the Quran thus describes Gog and Magog as agents of Fasad. They are people who corrupt everything on earth, leading the world to decadence and Godlessness.


“And there is a ban on a city which We have destroyed: that they (the residents) shall never return – until Gog and Magog are let through (their barrier), and they swiftly swarm down from every height (or spread out in every direction [taking control of the power in the world]).” (21:95-96)


This is the second instance where the Quran makes mention of Gog and Magog. This verse helps us identify Gog and Magog.

- There is only one town connected to Gog and Magog and that is Jerusalem or The Holy Land.


“Gog and Magog would walk until they reach the mountain of al- Khamr, and it is a mountain in Jerusalem…” (Sahih Muslim)


Flipping through the pages of history confirms that Jerusalem was destroyed twice and its people expelled.

(when the Israelite people committed grave sins and corrupted the word of the Lord God, they were expelled twice from the Holy Land, and the town was destroyed)


They could have never returned to Jerusalem if Gog and Magog weren't released.


Balfour Declaration


It was in the year 1917 when British General Allenby entered Jerusalem and declared, "Today, the crusades have ended." It was at this time that the British issued the Balfour Declaration, which stated that Britain would work for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Thus, after 2000 years, the Jewish people returned to the Holy Land. The Quran did explain this momentous event in history when it mentioned a people who would return to a town only after Gog and Magog are released.


Hence by logical deduction we say that it was Gog and Magog who brought the Jews back to the Holy Land, 2000 years after the Lord God had banned their entry. One of the great Islamic scholars of the 20th century, Muhammad Iqbal (popularly known as Allama Iqbal), stated regarding the events unfolding in the Holy Land after the Balfour Declaration:

Khul gai Yajooj aur Majooj ke lakshar tamaam, Aye Chashme Muslim dehk le tafseer-e-harfe yansilun

(All the forces of Gog and Magog have been let loose, O Muslim, ponder over the word Yansilun" [referring to ayah 21:96]).


We can now state that Gog and Magog are those who control power in the modern Western civilization. It is they who created the State of Israel in the Holy Land, and it is this civilization that has made Israel a nuclear power. Gog and Magog created the secular nation-states, the banking and monetary systems, and were behind the creation of international institutions such as the United Nations, IMF, WHO, etc.


As the Quran states they will spread out in all directions or descend from every height and that they are a people who spread Fasad, meaning they corrupt everything they touch. They gave the world a bogus monetary system (paper, digital, and cryptocurrency) to enslave mankind. Today, the rich get richer, and the poor remain in permanent poverty and destitution. They prohibited the use of gold and silver as money, making Haram (prohibited) what the Lord God made Halal (permissible)

(read "Confessions of an Economic Hitman" to understand the roles of banks in enslaving mankind).


These are people who use power to oppress; they want everyone to submit to them and accept their one-world order, the order of Gog and Magog. They control power in Israel today, hence are waging a brutal war in the Holy Land to fulfill their messianic agenda of a Greater Israel, which would pave the way for their Messiah (i.e., Dajjal) to rule the world from Jerusalem - a rule they think would be eternal! While we have explained briefly the role of Gog and Magog in today's world, it would be of great benefit for readers to read Sheikh Imran's books, such as "Jerusalem in the Quran" and "An Islamic View of Gog and Magog in the Modern World", to understand the subject in greater detail.


**3) Responding to oppression and the test of Faith**


The Prophet (ﷺ) declared: Whoever witnesses something which is wrong (e.g. and act of injustice) should change it with his ‘hand’, i.e. he should act to change it. If he is unable to do so then he should change it with his ‘tongue’, i.e. he should so denounce it that it may have the effect of bringing about some change. And if he is unable to even speak out against it then he should change it with his ‘heart’, i.e., he should detest it in his heart. And that, he said, was the weakest stage of faith. (Sahih Muslim)


There is tremendous oppression taking place in the Holy Land today; the Palestinian people are in danger of expulsion from their own lands. Yet, there hasn't been any significant challenge to Israeli oppression from the world of Islam. Those ruling over the Arab world (Gulf States) have been blinded by the modern Western civilization, and a terrible fate awaits such people. It is the failure of Islamic scholarship that has been unable to recognize the Gog and Magog world order.


The embarrassment is so great that we have failed to even recognize that the monetary and banking system, which has come from our enemy, is in complete violation of the truth that has come from the Lord God. The religious way of life faces an ominous test in this last age, be it any religious community.


The forces of evil have corrupted every aspect of our lives. The legalization of LGBT in most parts of the world shows how corrupted those who rule over us are; once you legalize a man marrying another man or vice versa, you are now part of that evil world order. Sharks do not care for international law, nor do they care for God's law; it is these sharks that are Gog and Magog.


Anas bin Malik narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “There shall come upon the people a time in which the one who is patient upon his religion will be like the one holding onto a burning ember." (Tirmidhi) 


In recent times, one of the best examples of resisting oppression was Malcolm X. He fought the entire system with matchless courage, integrity, honesty, and most importantly, with faith in the Lord God. It was his understanding of the world order that made him a force to reckon with; he challenged the very heart of oppression.


The resistance axis resisting against the oppressor is waging a historical struggle, yet they are in chains. They aren't only confronting the oppressor on the battlefield but also have to defy the world order. They must defy every institution, from the monetary system to the banking system, to state institutions, and to every international organization; they are fighting the world order of Gog and Magog!


To challenge evil, we must first recognize that evil and then educate the public with matchless integrity, courage, and honesty, without any fear of consequences. The religious world order must recognize the danger posed by those who control power in the Holy Land, and to confront that evil, we must unite as one.


**Israel today is not waging its war on behalf of the Jewish people; it is Gog and Magog who are waging a war on behalf of the Anti-Christ!**
