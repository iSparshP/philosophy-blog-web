The unsettling occurrences unfolding in the Holy Land can only be comprehended through the Eschatological framework, rather than traditional Islamic scholarship. The study of eschatology and an understanding of the ‘Zionist agenda’ is required to penetrate the depth of the subject . ‘The ayah in Surah Al-Ma'idah (i.e. 5:51) aids in recognizing the alliance of the Judeo-Christian (Anglo Zionist) group’ that currently wields global power.


**“O you, who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people”.**

**(Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:51)**


Note : This ayah does not forbid Muslims from maintaining friendly relationships with all Jews and Christians. Instead, it prohibits Muslims from forming alliances with those specific Jews and Christians who are allies of each other, in the context of Zionism, for instance.


The Zionist movement was created in the year 1897 in Basel, Switzerland with the primary objective of creating a homeland for the Jewish people and establishing the State of Israel. However, It wasn't solely about establishing Israel; it went beyond that, with the aim of elevating that Israel to become the dominant global power one day, otherwise known as the ruling state in the world. Today, Israel is on the verge of becoming that ruling state, below are some of the points on how Israel got to were it is today,


**Balfour declaration- General Allenby in 1917 issued a declaration to allow the return of the Jews to the holy land, this continued from 1917-1948.**

**The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.**

**The six day war in 1967 that allowed Israel to conquer the Golan Heights and take control of Jerusalem, hence expanding her territory.**

**A substantial military assistance package from the United States has propelled Israel into the status of a military superpower.**


In order for Israel to rule the world they need to take complete control of the holy land at the heart of which is Masjid Al-Aqsa. They need to further expand their territory and yet appear to the world that Israel is just defending herself. The Islamic resistance in and around the holy land poses a threat to Israel especially from Hezbollah on the northern front. Hezbollah is a well-equipped army with around 1,00,000 soldiers and around 1,30,000 missiles of which 40,000 pose a direct threat to Tel-Aviv. Furthermore, the Islamic Republic of Iran, both independently and through its regional proxies, presents an even more formidable challenge to the Zionist agenda. Israel's ability to fully seize control of Jerusalem and Masjid Al-Aqsa hinges on the elimination of the threat posed by Iran.


In our opinion the events on 7th of October had the same footprints to that of 9/11, both having the same macro objective of a war on Islam (which they describe as a war on terror). Israel must weaken resistance movements and deliver a significant blow to Iran to achieve its goals. This is why they are determined to engage in a multi-front war against all the resistance forces. The war on “Hamas” is actually a war on Iran and the ground invasion of Gaza is just one of the provocative move in order to expand the conflict beyond Gaza and get other countries involved.


Israel perceives this as an ideal moment to commence its warfare, considering the United States is grappling with both economic and military crises due to the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. For the reader's comprehension, it's essential to note that in order to attain global dominance, they must also displace the United States from its position of power and in order to do that Israel needs to get US to intervene in the war which would then turn out into a regional war. The likes of Joe Biden and co have been hijacked by the Zionists, hence the US aircraft carriers, F-16s, F-35s, UK Royal Navy and the various air defense batteries all on the Mediterranean in preparation for a regional conflict. Israel will employ all available means to instigate a response from Hezbollah, with the aim of involving the United States in the conflict.


Once Hezbollah is targeted, it is highly likely to trigger Iranian intervention, potentially leading to a full-scale war in the Middle East. It’s important to note that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz and once war breaks out it would result in the closure of the strait resulting in massive economic crises as the oil distribution will stop, which will lead to the collapse of the Us Dollar, understand the significance of the strait here.


Considering the United States is already facing financial turmoil, this action is likely to precipitate the devaluation of the dollar, potentially triggering a cascade effect on paper currencies worldwide and opening the path for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).


 

**Emergence Of The Jewish Mashiach**


Jews are still anticipating their Messiah, who, according to their belief, will govern the world from Jerusalem, ushering a period akin to their 'Golden Age,' i.e. the eras of Prophets David and Solomon (عليهم السلام). Meanwhile, Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) foretold the emergence of a man in the end times who will claim to be the Messiah, but the Prophet (ﷺ) clarified that this individual would be ‘the false Messiah, Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal,’, as Allah had already sent the true Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary (عليهم السلام), whom the Jews rejected.


The Prophet (ﷺ) also said that the Jews will believe in him as the Messiah and would follow him.

Anas bin Malik reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: **The Dajjal would be followed by seventy thousand Jews of Isfahan wearing Persian shawls.**

(Sahih Muslim, 2944)


It’s inevitable that a ‘Pax Judaica’ will emerge, because, in order for Dajjal to successfully impersonate the true Messiah, he would have to rule the world from Jerusalem. Hence, based on what we find in the holy texts we can say Palestine will no longer remain a state, Israel will go onto creating what they call the “Holy Israel” but in reality it will be an imposter State of Israel. The tyrant leaders of Israel will keep committing oppression in the holy land, the resistance however in the short run would be weakened but it can never be eradicated, the struggle for the holy land will continue until a Muslim army will march from Khorasan and conquer Jerusalem.


Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ) said: **"Black standards will come from Khorasan, nothing shall turn them back until they are planted in Jerusalem."**

(Jami` at-Tirmidhi, 2269)


The Zionists that day would have no hiding from the punishment of Allah as it's reported from Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, **"The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."**

(Sahih al-Bukhari, 2926)

Note: Jew here does not refer to all Jews but to the Zionists.


Not just the Jews but even their ‘Messiah’ i.e. Dajjal, will also be killed and the one who kills him will be Jesus, the true Messiah. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, Jesus (عليه السلام) would catch hold of Dajjal at the gate of Ludd (located in Palestine, in close proximity to al-Quds (Jerusalem) and would kill him).

(Sahih Muslim, 2937)


 

**The Fate Of Israel**


Twice did the Jews commit tyranny and oppression in the holy land before and the Lord God destroyed them twice with severe punishment.


**[And We conveyed to the Children of Israel in the Scripture that, "You will surely cause corruption on the earth twice, and you will surely reach [a degree of] great haughtiness." So when the [time of] promise came for the first of them, We sent against you servants of Ours - those of great military might, and they probed [even] into the homes, and it was a promise fulfilled. Then We gave back to you a return victory over them. And We reinforced you with wealth and sons and made you more numerous in manpower.**


**[And said], "If you do good, you do good for yourselves; and if you do evil, [you do it] to them [i.e., yourselves]." Then when the final [i.e., second] promise came, [We sent your enemies] to sadden your faces and to enter the masjid [i.e., the temple in Jerusalem], as they entered it the first time, and to destroy what they had taken over with [total] destruction. [Then Allāh said], "It is expected, [if you repent], that your Lord will have mercy upon you. But if you return [to sin], We will return [to punishment]. And We have made Hell, for the disbelievers, a prison-bed."]**

(Surah Al-Isra' 17:4-8)


Historically, Israel faced destruction twice, first by the Babylonian army and then by the Roman army. It's important to note that these instances were not limited to just two, as Allah's warning suggests that if they revert to their negative actions, His punishment may recur, possibly through another military intervention. The Prophet (ﷺ) prophesied that a Muslim army from Khorasan would play a role in their destruction for the third time. This potential destruction would result from their return to corruption, oppression, and tyranny in the holy land. Presently, this is evident with the ongoing Israeli actions and a pattern of oppression since the establishment of the State of Israel.


The ongoing events in the holy land should be a matter of serious concern for Muslims and all those who believe in the One God. It is crucial for us to delve into and thoroughly analyze this significant subject. It's anticipated that following this significant conflict, neither a two-state solution nor a one-state solution will emerge, but rather an impostor state of Israel, which they may label as "Holy Israel."


Nonetheless, the truth will ultimately prevail. Jesus, the son of Mary (عليهم السلام), the true Messiah, is expected to restore the authentic "holy state of Israel," akin to the time of Prophet David (عليه السلام), and rule over the world from Jerusalem. As the Prophet (ﷺ) stated, "The Hour will not be established until the son of Mary (i.e., Jesus) descends among you as a just ruler"

(Sahih al-Bukhari 2476).


**“They plan their plans and He plans His and He is the Best of the Planners”**


Lastly, we ask Allah to protect and safeguard the Muslims all around the world, to unite us, to make us stronger than ever, both spiritually and physically or militarily. We beseech Allah Rabbul 'Izzah that our brother and sisters in and around Palestine stay safe, and those who are martyred, be blessed with the highest level in Al Firdaus.
