Before we start, we request people to study in case you don't know 'the two worlds of Christianity' i.e., the Western Christianity and the Eastern Christianity because people having no idea about it would eventually be hellbent and reject whatever is being said here. We need to study about 'The Great Schism' and primarily we need to understand that Qur'ān mentions two kinds of Christians i.e., those Christians who are in friendship and alliance with the jews aka "Zionists" (Qur'ān 5:51) and then there are those Christians whom Allāh praises and helps them to be victorious (Qur'ān 30:5, Muslims celebrated when these Christians were victorious)


Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:82

You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate others with Allah; and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, **"1. We are Christians" That is because "2. among them are priests"" and "3. monks"" and because "4. they are not arrogant."**


What Christians is Allāh referring to in this āyah, who will be closest in affection to the Muslims?


1. The first description that Allāh makes here is that they are a people who are a proud Christians, their religion plays a very important role in their lives, a practicing Christians.


2. Allāh has further eased our task so that we can recognise them when the time comes hence He azzawajal informs us that these Christians will have the priesthood among them, they hold their priests high, respect them. We can elaborate this and say, they having priests points out that they will also have the institutes of priesthood.


3. The third point that Allāh makes of them is that they will also have monks among them so they have monasticism/monkhood, a people who live a monastic way of life, renouncing the worldly pleasures and focusing on spirituality.


The last description that Allāh makes here in this āyah is that He azzawajal gives us the reason why they are a proud Christians, why they have priesthood and why they have monasticism and says the reason why they have all these is **"because they are not an arrogant people"**


So, when we tried to find the people who practice these things mentioned in the āyah, we found only Orthtodox Christians/Eastern Christianity, hence we came to the conclusion and recognized that Allāh is speaking about the Orthodox Christianity in this āyah, from its people till its president we see them to be a people who have integrity, people who can't digest oppression and people who are God fearing & God conscious.


We request the readers to do their homework and try to find these people and let us know if you come to a different conclusion.

**We invite and entertain only a scholarly and an academic approach to our view.**


It is our view and you don't have to accept our view unless you are convinced that it is correct. However people who critique our view and say we are wrong must come to us with what they consider as 'right' , this is the correct approach.


To make your homework easy we would like to inform you that the Western Christianity fails in all of these aspects that are mentioned in the āyah 5:82.


**The Western Christianity says**

1. Keep your religion to your homes and personal lives (not a proud Christians), it's also apparent to the eyes that

2. They don't care for their priests infact a Hollywood actress is more respected in the West and priests play no role in their society at all.

3. The West is selling its Churches and Cathedrals to become Masājid and McDonald's and lastly

4. The West is arrogant and wants to impose its rule over the world & oppresses those who resist their rule.


People are also suggested to research on what is known as "The Great Schism" or "The East-West Schism" and to help clear some of the brainwashing regarding Russia, people are suggested to research on "Zionists, Israel & USSR" because many consider USSR and modern day Russia to be the same.
