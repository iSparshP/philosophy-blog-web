**Introduction**


It has now been more than 10 months since the 24th of February, 2022 and the war in Ukraine is still raging and showing no signs of abating. When Russia launched the SMO (special military operation), it was believed that once Russia achieves her objectives, this war will end with negotiations with Ukraine surrendering to Russian demands and its military in no position to ever join NATO. But most of us now must understand that negotiations are no longer possible and the SMO has unofficially changed into a war with the collective West. The neocons have succeeded to a degree by prolonging this conflict by sending weapons, mercenaries, billions of dollars, NATO operators (who are guiding the Ukrainian armed forces) and have used their propaganda machine (aka, the main stream media) which we consider as their biggest weapon to brainwash the population. The question now arises, where are we heading towards and how is this all going to end?


**Prolongation of the war**


Without the interference of the United States and its NATO allies, Ukraine would have been destroyed in a couple of months and Zelensky would have either been killed or would have flown to Washington. But, the neocons are hell bent on war with Russia and have used Zelensky as a puppet and Ukraine as a proxy. Ukraine is just being used as a battleground, but the unfortunate reality is that the war is between Russia and US/NATO.

Here are some events we would like to list out that have helped the neocons prolong this war:


1) The US wartime assistance of more than $100 billion, which includes air defense system such as the Patriot missile battery, HIMARS, etc. Also adding to that the NATO retired officers are running the Ukrainian army.


2) Zelensky’s visit to Washington to meet Joe Biden and the congress giving him a massive welcome. The last time a world leader got such a welcome was Benjamin Netanyahu. So one can imagine who are the ones ruling over congress.


3) The blowing up of Nord stream 2, the blast on the Crimean bridge, a drone attack on Sevastopol, and more recently attacks on the Russian nuclear air bases all indicating to false flag terror attacks.


4) Economic sanctions by the collective West on Russia even though they have backfired dramatically like a boomerang effect on all of the European nations as well as the United States itself. But with their propaganda machine they have succeeded in somewhat brainwashing the population into thinking Russia is massively suffering as an economy and hence people will revolt and remove Putin from the office.


**Russian response**


First thing that we need to understand is that this war is an existential threat to Russia. We must consider ourselves very lucky to have leaders like Putin, Lavrov, etc. Every decision taken by them has been measured and is being taken with keeping in mind the fate of the world unlike the ruling elites of the west who have no integrity and don’t care for anything or anyone except their evil agendas. Russia’s main goal was the denazification and disarming of the Ukrainian army, but now it has become clear it is not just the Ukrainian army but Russia also has to disarm the NATO. With attacks on Crimean bridge, Sevastopol and the destruction of Nord stream 2, it became clear to Russia that the West and Ukraine aren’t interested in any sort of negotiations.


In response, Russia has been taking down energy infrastructure in Ukraine with its precision guided missiles, the main goal of hitting the power grids is to disrupt the weapons supply that comes mostly through railways. Russia has made new partners in central Asia which has strengthened the Ruble even more in response to the economic sanctions by the West. Just recently Putin announced that Russia will be banning oil production to countries that have announced an oil price cap on Russia. To be honest Russia is telling to the West we don’t need you anymore!


Putin stated last week that he wants this war to end soon and the more the war drags on the more likely we will see nuclear weapons being used. Hence, we feel the Russians will soon launch a massive offensive in Ukraine, and general Surovikin wants that to be the final nail in the coffin for the Ukrainian army, only thing he is waiting for is the ground to completely freeze in the whole of Ukraine which will favor the movement of the Russian army.


**Poland- The next Neocon False flag?**


If sources are to be believed there is a mobilization of troops in Poland, up to 2,00,000 troops are being prepared to enter Ukraine, this does indicate that Poland is trying to bite off some piece of Ukraine under the guise of some kind of peacekeeping mission, but we also believe this could be another false flag by the neocons which would lead to an expansion of the conflict. If and when Poland does enter Ukraine, those 2,00,000 are most certainly to be annihilated by the Russians, how will the West act after that remains to be seen?


We believe this to be a credible source of information as it has also been stated by Gonzalo Lira as well as Col. MacGregor. Here is a explanation from Gonzalo Lira https://youtu.be/GpdJ_FXHiPk


**Where are we heading towards?**


As a student of eschatology, It’s important to analyze the situation according to the Qur'an, which is ’The Absolute Truth’ and the most authentic source of knowledge. Russia is fighting the satanic West, Russia the leader of Orthodox Christianity is destined to be victorious in this war.


UK’s MI-6 Richard Moore tweeted “With the tragedy and destruction unfolding in Ukraine, we should remember the values and hard won freedoms that distinguish us from Putin, none more than LGBT+ rights. So let’s resume our series of tweets to mark #LGBTHM2022”.

We Know the fate that awaits those who promote homosexuality, a people who are driven to madness by Satan. Take a look at this verse of the Quran, **“I (Allah) leave this as a sign for the people to come” meaning if you return to this (homosexuality), I will return with my punishment.”**    


Ibn ‘Abbas (r) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:**“Whoever you find doing as the people of Lut did (i.e. homosexuality), kill the one who does it and the one to whom it is done, and if you find anyone having sexual intercourse with animal, kill him and kill the animal. And the Prophet (ﷺ) cursed such people”**


The punishment of Allah will soon befall on the West, a terrible punishment!

In order to read history we need to be able to connect the dots, the combination of global stagnation and short-sighted monetary nationalism set the stage for World War 2. Since the last two years due to the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, the global economy is again on the verge of facing a recession.


Between the first and the Second World War, it was Pax Britannica that was on its way out facing massive military losses and economic crises. It was the Bretton wood accord that brought an end to the sterling pound as the reserve currency of the world and hence the US dollar succeeded in replacing the sterling pound as the next reserve currency of the world.

According to Judy Shelton, an economic advisor to Donald Trump, in her book economic meltdown explains how the chaos of the monetary system can lead to a global catastrophe (Great war). We are now on the verge of that global currency chaos as the US dollar is about to lose its status as the ruling currency of the world.


There is an ominous prophecy of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) that is related to a great war over the monetary system which in His symbolic language is referring to as ’the mountain of gold’, the Hadith says **“The river Euphrates will uncover a mountain of gold and every 99 out of 100 who fight for that gold will be killed and the believers should not touch that gold”**


We are now located at a point in history when the petrodollar monetary system is being threatened by Russia and China and the United States is hell bent on protecting its status as the ruling state in the world. To cover up for the economic meltdown and the De-dollarization (read our blog on De-dollarization) that is taking place, the hegemony needs the great war. And Ukraine is precisely taking us to that moment in history.
