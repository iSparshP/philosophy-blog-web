A strange world, an ultimate conman in charge at Washington and a right winged extremist government in the Holy land perusing her messianic imperial agenda. The ‘Make America Great Again’ campaign seems to be more or less ‘Make Israel Great Again’. What explains such an American obsession with the State of Israel? It surely does not matter whether you are red or blue, Joe Biden or Donald J. Trump; there is no stopping the Israeli war machine with her obsession to take control of the territory from River Nile to the Euphrates.


Trump surely has shattered his peacemaker facade with the resumption of the genocide in Gaza, the direct US involvement in the bombing of Yemen and now beating the drums of war against Iran.


Here are some of his recent war mongering threats to Iran, “Iran is very high on my list of things to watch. … We will have to talk it out or very bad things are going to happen to Iran…. My big preference is that we work it out with Iran, but if we don’t work it out, bad, bad things are going to happen to Iran.”, he also further went on to state a day or two later, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing- and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before”.


Setting the stage
Trump certainly isn’t bluffing anymore as some may like us to believe, he is just seeking to take advantage of a new geopolitical reality that has taken shape since October 7th 2023. Around the first week of March, Trump had sent a letter with a two month deadline to the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, stating (threatening according to Iranian officials) the need to make a deal. While the complete letter wasn’t officially revealed to the public, there have been certain important details coming out; the letter includes a return to the negotiations on the Iranian nuclear program (a deal that Donald Trump himself unilaterally withdrew from, JCPOA, during his first term as president), demanding Iran abandon its ballistic missile program and eliminating any support towards the axis of resistance.


Iran is just not another piece of territory in the region. It is an ancient, deeply nationalistic civilizational society where even opponents of the ruling elite rally when foreign threats emerge. Soleimani’s assassination proved this. The Iranian response has been plain and clear; no direct negotiations with the United States while it will maintain indirect negotiations with respect to its nuclear program. The other two demands seem unrealistic. The Iranians have further summoned the Swiss ambassador and warned any US attack will trigger an Iranian response. Iran has also filed an official complain to the UN, stating “Donald Trump’s remarks as “reckless and aggressive” and a “blatant violation” of global legal norms. Ayatollah Khamenei also warned in his Eid sermon “any evil attack against Iran will lead to a harsh and decisive response”.

 

Going by the above developments, the Iranians are considering threats from Trump as serious and have already started preparing for such a scenario. The current US military posture in the Middle East is also a sign of an US attack being planned on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Recent reports and satellite imagery indicate a significant buildup of US military assets at Diego Garcia, a strategic base in the Indian Ocean. The Pentagon has deployed seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers (capable of carrying nuclear payloads) numerous C-17 transport planes, ten KC-135 refueling tankers, an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine, and two carrier groups to locations where they can be used in a preemptive attack on Iran.


Dire consequences
An attack on Iran will lead to a catastrophic situation around the world. It will most certainly lead to the closure of the strategic “Strait of Hormuz” through which 25-40% of the world oil trade passes. Iran will have no choice but to carry out such a threat which would leave the big oil producers such as Kuwait and the UAE unable to export oil to Japan, China and the rest of the world. The price of oil will instantly shoot up to around $300- 500 per barrel, inevitably leading to the collapse of the dollar. It is important to note that the current monetary system isn’t backed by anything, it is surviving on confidence. As long as there is demand for the dollar, it survives. As soon as demand falls, the dollar loses all its credibility. With US dollar being the reserve currency, the value of paper will dramatically collapse, leaving it worthless hence leading to a hyperinflation similar to the great depression of 1929.


As regards to the military perspective, most US bases around the Persian Gulf are sitting ducks given the advanced state of the art ballistic missile technology Iran possess. Iran also has a very sophisticated modern air defense system which complicates things for the US and Israeli air force. While there is no doubt that a joint US/ Israeli attack would inflict massive damage on Iranian nuclear sites, critical infrastructure and oil production facilities; there is also no doubt that Iran will in turn inflict some serious damage to the US installations in the region. Iran has shaped its military doctrine to fit its own defensive requirements and its own unique geographical situation. In short, Iran would have the “home team” advantage.


Considering the dire consequences for the world and in particular for the United States, Trump seems ignorant and hell bent on waging war on Israel’s behalf.


A very senior economist and a political analyst Jeffery Sachs states, Netanyahu’s been gunning for war with Iran for years, and we’ve been following along… Six wars in the Middle East led by Israel with U.S. backing, and now they want a seventh. “Is the US using Israel? No, no, no. This is Israel using the US as if our military is in their hands…”

Sachs hints towards the complete control of the Israeli lobby on US foreign policy. With the Israelis Trump is not floundering. He is picking up just where his genocidal predecessor left off and so getting done exactly what he wants. Just as Joe Biden was, Trump is acutely careful never to put a foot wrong with the Zionists. To understand this Israeli influence over the United States and the mysterious American and British obsession with the Holy Land, we need to dive down briefly at history and explain the grand design that has been accelerating since the Jewish return to the Holy Land since the Balfour deceleration.

 

The Grand Design
A former British diplomat, Alastair Crooke stated recently that the current war waged by Israel cannot be understood or analyzed without considering an eschatological perspective. There is a grand design that links international politics and religion with the current war’s Israel has been waging since October 7th, 2023.


Jews believe in a divine promise communicated to the Israelite people in which the Lord God promised that history would end with one man, who would be a Prophet and the Messiah, ruling the whole world from the throne of David (pbuh) in Holy Jerusalem with eternal rule. Jews concluded there-from that history would end with Pax Judaica (a Judeo-world-order), and with Jerusalem once more at the center of the world as it was at the time of Solomon (pbuh).


With the rejection of Jesus, the true Messiah, the Jews still await their Messiah who would liberate the Holy Land for the Jews, ‘bring them back to the Holy Land to reclaim it as their own, restore the Holy State of Israel in the Holy Land (i.e., the Holy Israel that was created by the Prophets David and Solomon), and then cause that Israel to become the ruling state in the world. That Messiah would then rule the world from Holy Jerusalem with Pax Judaica and bring back the Jewish golden age.’


The Muslims and Christians hold the belief that the Messiah that the Jews are waiting for is the Anti- Christ, who will try to impersonate the true Messiah, Jesus (pbuh).

 

It was around 1896, when the Zionist movement created by Theodor Herzl gained momentum towards an establishment of a home for the Jewish people. A people scattered in diaspora where to be soon brought back to the Holy Land after 2000 years in exile. Astonishingly, it was a Judeo-Christian alliance that led the way for the settlement of the Jewish people in the Holy Land and then further led to the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Such Judeo-Christian people could best be described as Euro Jewish and Euro Christian as they had absolutely no links with the original Bani Israel (the children of Israel).

 

This mysterious Jewish-Christian alliance (i.e. Zionist alliance) emerged from the modern western civilization which laid claim to the Holy Land. The Holy Quran prophesied the evil of such an alliance and warned the believers against maintaining any ties with them in Chapter 5 verse 51, “O believers! Do not take such Jews and Christians as friends/allies who themselves are friends/allies (i.e., The Zionist alliance) of each other. Whoever does so will be counted as one of them. Surely, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.”

 

Pax Judaica
In order for Israel to fulfil her messianic destiny, it has to rule the world. The territory of Israel must dramatically expand from the river of Nile to the river of Euphrates; the biblical destiny that she lays claim to. For Israel to rule the world, it has to first and foremost rule over the Arabs either directly or through proxy and ensure most of the region is in complete submission to the State of Israel. Also like the United States, Israel has to become a ruling state of the world and a financial superpower.

Note: The leading bankers in New York are mostly Jews, the Jews already have control over the world of money, and this has also been the case under Pax Britannica, Nathan Rothschild, who was a Jew once boasted, “I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply.”


As the transfer of world power was shifting from Pax Britannica to Pax Americana, the world witnessed two big wars; the first and then the Second World War. Around the same time in the 1930’s the world also witnessed the Great Depression, which was artificially contrived using currency devaluations to increase the competitiveness of a country's export products in order to reduce balance of payments deficits — resulted in plummeting national incomes, shrinking demand, mass unemployment, and an overall decline in world trade. However, it prepared the way for the imposition of an international monetary system that ostensibly sought to bring order and prevent chaos in the world of money and trade. This culminated with the creation of a new monetary system at Bretton Woods in 1944 and officially transferring the financial capital from London to New York.

 

Israel’s big wars and her lust for territorial expansion were on the table long before, it only needed a casus belli (i.e. justification) in order to expand her regional dominance over the Arab world. The launch of Al- Aqsa flood on the morning of October 7th, 2023 gave Israel the perfect opportunity to put her messianic agenda into overdrive. More in depth explanation can be read here, 


This brings us to the current state of the war where the attention is now being moved towards Iran. Before moving towards Iran, Israel had to make sure that the axis of resistance is severely weakened and poses no significant threat to Israel. The dynamics of the region have completely changed since October 7th. Israel now occupies large areas in Southern Syria which includes the most strategic point in the Levant, i.e. Mount Hermon. With the regime change in Syria, Israeli air force now operates freely in Syria and has destroyed most of the advanced air defence systems and missiles of the previous Syrian regime. With Hezbollah severely weakened, Lebanon is on the way to complete submission towards Israel. Hamas too no longer poses any threat be it in Gaza or the West Bank where Israel is heading towards the extermination of the Palestinians and complete territorial sovereignty. Donald Trump has taken the matter in his own hands with the Houthis in Yemen and is waging a war on Israel’s behalf, trying to make the region even safer for Israel. Iran remains the only significant power in the region challenging Israel and resisting the Zionist world order, which is the reason why Netanyahu is lusting for war with Iran.


The moment has arrived
With the bombing of an Iranian consulate in Damascus and with an assassination of Ismail Haniyah in Tehran last year it seemed Israel would finally succeed in provoking Iran in such a way which would have then triggered a joint US/ Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear and energy facilities. It seemed after Iran’s true promise two; Israel would launch a large scale attack on Iran. Yet, Israel chose to retaliate on a smaller scale avoiding a large scale war. There could be many factors involved considering why Israel chose the lesser option to avoid a bigger war with Iran. One of the reasons was that the United States under Joe Biden did not fall for the trap and hence decided not to interfere on Israel’s behalf; this was also clarified by Benjamin Netanyahu recently in a Hebrew interview where he stated Joe Biden threatened to block all weapons supply to Israel had Israel gone forward with a large scale attack on Iran’s nuclear and energy facilities. The second reason could very well be that Israel was still engaged in a war with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria was still under Assad (Syria under Assad had a sophisticated AD system which complicated matters for the Israeli air force).


Israel is now placed in a much better position and with Donald Trump in the White House, and his warmongering rhetoric towards Iran followed by a massive US military build-up in the region; Netanyahu knows this is an opportunity of a life time!


Writing is on the wall
The war with Iran will completely shake the global economic order; it will lead to a complete collapse of paper money. It will then pave way for the final stage of evolution in their monetary system which would witness the universal embrace of electronic money, the brightest jewel of their evil monetary crown. The United States will be devastated with the collapse of the monetary system and strategically defeated in the region. Iran will also suffer devastating consequences. With the weakening of the entire resistance axis and the leader of the axis, Israel could also use this is as an opportunity to destroy Al Aqsa mosque and establish the third Temple further accelerating her messianic destiny.
