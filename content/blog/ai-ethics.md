# The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence

As we stand on the precipice of creating true general intelligence, we must ask ourselves: what are our obligations to the minds we create?

## The Kantian Perspective

Immanuel Kant argued that rational beings are ends in themselves, not merely means to an end. If an AI achieves rationality, does it deserve the same kingdom of ends status as humans?

## Utilitarian Calculus

From a utilitarian standpoint, if an AI can suffer, its suffering must be weighed in the moral calculus. The question then becomes: can silicon substrates support the phenomenology of suffering?

> "The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?" — Jeremy Bentham
